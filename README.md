# MITRE ATT&CK Data Sources
This repo contains my (Tareq's) work on MITRE ATT&CK data sources. Details about each section are included in the relevant Medium Blog posts.

## Data Sources Ordered By Collection Priority
The aim here is to create a prioritized list of data sources that is based on objective metrics. Full details are at the link below, but the general criteria for ordering are:
1. Prioritize sources that can be collected, for obvious reason.
1. Prioritize sources with lower volume.Â 
1. Prioritize sources that do not require collection from all hosts.
1. Prioritize sources by the number of subtechniques.
1. Prioritize source by the number of techniques.
